# FTPMount
Amiga Handler to mount FTP sites as a filesystem device

# Requirements
A cross compiler (e.g. VBCC, GCC) or SAS/C 6.58 on a real/emulated Amiga.
Roadshow SDK files
NDK 3.9 files
The rest of the installation package from Aminet if you want to install it on a real Amiga.

# Description
This is work-in-progress, trying to back-port the AmigaOS4 port to OS3 68k,
including all the bugfixes from there. Part of the attempt is to allow the
sources to compile with any compiler chosen, not just SAS/C (which was the
original) or GCC (for AmigaOS4).

Feel free to contribute, fork and improve what you see.
